## Game

### Idea
Our game has a spaceship fly through space to go through rings while dodging asteroids.

The point of the game is to go through as many rings as possible and to avoid hitting asteroids. As the player stays alive longer in the game and goes through more rings, the player will get more points. The player will also game a certain number of points every time they fully go through a ring, not just a side of the ring.

At the beginning of the game, the player has three lives. The player will lose a life once they hit an asteroid, and the game will get harder as the player stays alive longer in the game. In order to make the game harder, there will be more asteroids popping up. In addition, the longer the player stays in the game, the rings will start to move to make it harder for the player to go through them.

We will also have hearts that pop up that the player can hit to gain an extra life.

The spaceship will be movable through the left, right, up, and down arrow keys, so the user can move the spaceship from up and down or left to right to dodge asteroids or go through rings. As the spaceship moves, smoke will come out from the back.

### Advanced Topics
1. Collision detection
We used collision detection when we are seeing if our spaceship hit an asteroid, goes through a ring, or hits a heart.
2. OBJ files
We use OBJ files to generate the shapes for the asteroids, rings, and hearts.
3. Bump mapping
We used bump mapping to texture the spaceship and asteroids.
4. Smoke
We used smoke that comes out of the spaceship as it moves.
